# ShapePlane
A generative art application written in Java using the Processing library. Generates a vector grid of shapes.

# Running the program
After downloading the sourcecode, you will need to set up Processing to run ShapePlane.
* Download [Processing](https://processing.org/) 
* In Processing you need to install processing-java which can be found in the Tools tab.
* Install the controlP5 library from `Sketch > Import Library > Add Library` (last known working version 2.2.6)

Once processing-java and the libraries are installed, you're ready to run ShapePlane!

# Controls
* Left-arrow: Show/hide controls.
* Right-arrow: Generate new image with random seed.
* Down-arrow: Go back to the previous random seed and image.
* Up-arrow: Save image PDF and preset.

Saved images and presets can be found in the `images` and `presets` folders inside `<USER HOME>/Documents/ShapePlane/`
